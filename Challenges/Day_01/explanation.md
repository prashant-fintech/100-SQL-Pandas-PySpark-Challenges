# üìä Solution Explanation: SQL, Pandas, and PySpark

## üìù Problem Recap
The objective is to **classify the ad performance of products** based on their **total units sold**.  
The classification follows these rules:

| Items Sold   | Ad Performance |
|-------------|---------------|
| 30+         | **Outstanding** |
| 20 - 29     | **Satisfactory** |
| 10 - 19     | **Unsatisfactory** |
| 1 - 9       | **Poor** |

Each solution processes a dataset containing **sales transactions**, where we have:
- **`product_id`** ‚Äì Identifies the product.
- **`quantity`** ‚Äì Number of units sold per transaction.
- **`created_at`** ‚Äì Timestamp of the purchase.
- **`user_id`** ‚Äì Unique customer identifier.

## üõ† **SQL Thought Process**
### **Step 1: Aggregate Sales Data**
- We **group the dataset by `product_id`** to calculate the **total quantity sold** for each product.

### **Step 2: Categorize Ad Performance**
- Using a **CASE statement**, we assign a **performance category** based on the total number of units sold.
- If a product has **30+ sales**, it is **Outstanding**; for **1-9 sales**, it is **Poor**.

### **Step 3: Order the Results**
- Finally, we **sort the results** in descending order of total units sold, so high-performing products appear at the top.

## üêº **Pandas Thought Process**
### **Step 1: Read and Process Data**
- We **load the dataset** and convert timestamps for proper handling.

### **Step 2: Aggregate Sales Data**
- We **group the DataFrame by `product_id`** and sum the `quantity` column to get the **total units sold** per product.

### **Step 3: Define Performance Categories**
- A function is created to **map total sales to performance categories**.
- The function checks the sales number and assigns the corresponding **ad performance level**.

### **Step 4: Sort the Data**
- The results are **sorted in descending order** of total units sold.

### **Step 5: Display or Export the Results**
- The final DataFrame can be printed, saved as a CSV, or visualized.

## üî• **PySpark Thought Process**
### **Step 1: Load the Data into a Distributed Environment**
- Since PySpark is designed for **big data processing**, we read the dataset into a **Spark DataFrame**.

### **Step 2: Aggregate Total Units Sold**
- We **group the data by `product_id`** and sum the `quantity` column to compute total sales.

### **Step 3: Apply Conditional Logic for Classification**
- Instead of using a function like in Pandas, we leverage **PySpark's `when` and `otherwise` conditions** to classify performance.

### **Step 4: Optimize Sorting and Processing**
- We sort the results **in descending order** to show high-performing products first.

### **Step 5: Scale for Large Datasets**
- Unlike Pandas (which works in memory), PySpark **distributes computations across multiple nodes**, making it suitable for massive datasets.

## üéØ **Comparison of Approaches**
| Approach  | Strengths |
|-----------|----------|
| **SQL**   | Best for structured databases, optimized querying. |
| **Pandas** | Ideal for small-to-medium datasets, flexible transformations. |
| **PySpark** | Designed for big data, scalable for large datasets. |

### üöÄ **Choosing the Right Approach**
- Use **SQL** if working with **relational databases**.
- Use **Pandas** if working with **Python scripts & DataFrames**.
- Use **PySpark** for **big data processing** across multiple machines.

Each approach **solves the same problem** but is optimized for different use cases.

Hope this breakdown helps! Let me know if you need modifications. üòä
