## 📌 Introduction  
Welcome to the **100 SQL, Pandas & PySpark Challenges** repository! 🎯  

At the start of 2025, I embarked on a journey to share 100 SQL challenges to help professionals sharpen their SQL skills with real-world problems. However, due to other priorities, the series took an unexpected pause.  

🔥 **Now, it’s back—stronger and better!**  

I am restarting the series from **Day 1**, refining past challenges and adding new insights. This time, each challenge will include solutions in:  
✅ **SQL** (For database queries)  
✅ **Pandas** (For Python-based data manipulation)  
✅ **PySpark** (For big data processing)  

Join me in solving these challenges, learning new tricks, and mastering **SQL, Pandas, and PySpark** along the way! 🚀

## 🏆 Challenge Format  
Each challenge will follow this structured format:  
- **📝 Problem Statement**: A real-world SQL query problem  
- **🛠 Solutions in**:  
  - **SQL** (`solution.sql`)  
  - **Pandas** (`solution_pandas.py`)  
  - **PySpark** (`solution_pyspark.py`)
